# 04: Consumer behavior of the population in the canton of Lucerne
Different persona are to be compiled on the basis of data from Bfs and LuStat to raise awareness of environmental issues


# Idea
The state of our earth is critical and the issue “environment” must be actively addressed. With our project we want to offer a remedy; the aim of the project is to sensitize the population in the canton of Lucerne to the topic of the environment.

# Challenge
Various persona are to be compiled on the basis of data that provide information on budget income/expenditure, demographic characteristics, opinions on the environment in the Canton of Lucerne, as well as data that describe the population's perception of the environment at federal level. The personas produced will describe the individual consumer groups.

On the one hand, the data at cantonal level from the LUStat and Bfs will help us to make direct statements about the Canton of Lucerne, and on the other hand, the data from Bfs at federal level can be linked by age group, household size and other factors and thus help us to draw conclusions. These findings can be used to raise awareness of environmental issues among the relevant groups. In addition, further measures for environmental counselling can be derived, such as marketing campaigns to actively address the relevant consumer group. 

# Goal
The personas produced will describe the individual consumer groups.
